**Determines the valuation of a company using sales data**

Python

## Introduction
This program uses a modified DCF model with the EBIT multiple determined by a weighted "risk score". 
The score is based on key value drivers extracted from raw sales data input. Drivers calculated are customer retention, customer volume, and earnings volatility.
