# eSharkTank
**Intuitively determines the valuation of an e-Commerce company using sales data**

Python

## Introduction
This program uses a custom DCF analysis method that functions like a neuron in a neural network. Key value drivers are first extracted from the raw multi-year sales data, i.e, customer retention, customer volume, and earnings volatility. The key value drivers are then used to calculate a weighted risk score and return an appropriate EBIT multiple based on risk level
